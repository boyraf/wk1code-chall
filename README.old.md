####Core Deliverables
As a user you can:

See a table of all transactions.
 Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should add the new transaction to the table *the new transaction does not have to be persisted to the backend*
Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions table.
